After looking at a few online tutorials for command line and GUI based (SourceTree) GIT when using distributed collaboration and came to the conclusion that is is far easier to use command line if utilizing branching to track changes.  SourceTree released a new update and it is somewhat easier to use now.

===============================  IMPORTANT READ THIS ===========================
Your Identity
The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the --global option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system. If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the --global option when you’re in that project.
Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.
Your Editor
Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message. If not configured, Git uses your system’s default editor.
If you want to use a different text editor, such as Emacs, you can do the following:
$ git config --global core.editor emacs ( or whatever editor you like )



Using Git to access and contribute to this project:

1. Clone (fork) the project.  This will make a complete copy of the repository to your computer.  You will now have a local repository and a reference to the remote repository.

2. Create a Branch and locate yourself in the branch.  This will isolate your changes / additions in the repositories while you work on them.

A great beginning Git tutorial is: http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/

The best learning aid for the command line I found is: https://git-scm.com/.

Git will work on GitHub and Bitbucket repositories.

the GitHub UI is also good for managing the remote repository.
